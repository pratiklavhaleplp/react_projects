### **Data fetching**
- The Unidirectional Data Flow of React and how it can make our applications easier to reason about
- How a c**hild can communicate with its parent** using callbacks
- The way **two siblings can share** data through their common parent
- How to create a **generic HoC**, which can fetch data from any API endpoints
- How **react-refetch** works and why it is a useful tool that we can integrate into our projects to make data fetching easier.

- **Data Fetching**
    - There are two lifecycle hooks where we can put the data fetching: **componentWillMount** and **componentDidMount**. The **first is fired before the component gets rendered for the first time and the second is fired right after the component is mounted**.
