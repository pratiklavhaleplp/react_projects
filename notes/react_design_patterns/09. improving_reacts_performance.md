### **Improving React's Performance**
- There are multiple tools that we can import into our codebase to monitor performance and find bottlenecks. 
- immutability and the PureComponent are the perfect tools to build fast React applications.
- Topics needs to consider for performance.
    - **Reconciliation**
    - use of **shouldComponentUpdate** and **pureComponents**
    - use of **immutable data**.
- **Reconciliation** 
    - When ever the sate changes react renders what is inside the render method. 
    - React is smart enough to figure out the minimum set of operations required to apply the expected changes on the screen.
    - Process of checking and updating the DOM is called **reconciliation** and it is managed transparently by React.
    - React tries to apply the smallest possible number of operations on the DOM because touching the **Document Object Model** is an expensive operation.
    - React makes two assumptions to reduce its complexity of comparing two trees.
        - If two **elements** have a **different type**, they render a different tree.
        - **Developers** can use **keys to mark children as stable across different render calls**
- **You should use stateless components when required and render them with memo** 
    - create a stateless component with memo is the way you can create a **pure component** which is going to render only when the prop values get changed.
