### **Intoduction**
- Declarative programming: way of describing what you want to achieve.
    - Difference between declarative and imparative programming
    ```
    <!-- Declarative -->
    toLowerCase(['FOO', 'BAR']); 

    <!-- Imparative -->
    const toLowerCase = input => {
        const output = []
        for (let i = 0; i < input.length; i++) {
        output.push(input[i].toLowerCase())
        }
        return output
    };


    Discussion: Writing whole function can be called as imperative programming while just calling a function called as declarative programming
    ```
- **React elements**: Because of Declarative programming in react you just need to declare the component and on the basics of simple instruction react will take care of rendering the components. Because of such feature there might be multiple instance of your component that react is currently holding.
    - To control the UI-Flow React used a particular type of object called as **element** which describes what has to be shown on the UI.
