### **Event Listners**
- **Controlled Components**: Having predefined values in the form/ html
    ```
     const Uncontrolled = () => (
        <form>
        <input type="text" />
        <button>Submit</button>
        </form>
    )
    ```
- **UnControlled Components**: Having no values associated with the form/ html element.
    ```
    const Controlled = () => (
        <form>
        <input type="text" value="Hello React" />
        <button>Submit</button>
        </form>
    )
    ```
- **Refs** there might be some cases where you need to access the underlying DOM nodes to perform some imperative operations. If you want to make a input focus then you can do it on button click with the help of refs check how we can implement this with youTube video.
