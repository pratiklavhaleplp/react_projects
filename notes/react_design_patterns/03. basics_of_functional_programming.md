### **Functional Programming**
- Through writing functional programming style code you can cleanup your JSX.
- Functional programming is a declarative paradigm where side effects are avoide and data is consdered as immutable which makes our code easier to maintain and reason about. 
- **Functional Programming concepts**
    - Functions are **first class objects**
        ```
        const func = (x, y)=>{
            return x + y;
        };
        ```
    - **Purity** A function is pure when there is no sideeffects associated with it. Which means function will not change anything which is not realted to function. Functions which are changing the state, manupulating DOM are called as **IMPURE** functions.
        ```
        <!-- pure -->
        const add = (x, y) => x + y;
        ```
        ```
        <!-- impure -->
        let x = 0;
        const add = (x, y) => {
            x = x + y;
        }
        ```
    - **Immutablity** An immutable value is a value that can not be changed.
        ```
        <!-- MUTABLE -->
        const arr = [1, 2, 3];
        arr.push(4);
        arr.push(5);
        console.log(arr);

        <!-- output -->
        Â [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        
        Array is getting mutate i.e, the value is changing.
        ```
        ```
        <!-- IMMUTABLE -->
        const arr = [1, 2, 3];
        const arrNew = arr.concat(4);
        const arrNew2 = arr.concat(5);

        console.log(arr); // [1, 2, 3]
        console.log(arrNew2); // [1, 2, 3, 5]

        Discussion: arr is not getting changed which shows that we acheived immutability. If you want to use manupulated array which is arrNew and arrNew2.
        ```
    - **Currying** Converting a function taking multiple arguments into function which takes one argument.
        ```
        const add = (x, y)=> x + y;

        const add = x => y => x + y;
        add(2)(3);

        Discussion: add, x, y all are functions. 
        ```
        ```
        function add(first){
            return function(second){
                return function(){
                    return first + second;
                }
            }
        }

        add(6)(7)();
        calling add on add calling innner function and after that calling inner most function that will give you the result.
        ```
    - **Composition** function containing another function.
        ```
        const add = (x, y)=> x + y;
        const square = (x) => x * x;

        const result = square(add(3,4));
        console.log(result);
        ```
    - **FP and UI**
        ```
        UI = f(state);

        Discussion: Duilding user interface UI with state as the state of the UI element and f as the functional Programming functions.
        ```
