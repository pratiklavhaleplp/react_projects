### **Introduction**
- How **components communicate** with each other using **props and children**
- The **Container and Presentational** pattern and how it can make our code more maintainable
- The problem mixins tried to solve and why **they failed**
- What **HoCs** are and how we can **structure our applications** in a **better way**, thanks to them
- The **recompose library** with its ready-made functions
- How we can **interact with the context** and avoid coupling our components to it What is the Function as Child component pattern and what are its benefits?

- **Communication between your components** **Reusable components** can be shared across multiple domains of your application to avoid duplication.
    - **Composing react component**
        ```
         const Profile = ({ user }) => (
            <div>
            <Picture profileImageUrl={user.profileImageUrl} />
            <UserName name={user.name} screenName={user.screenName} />
            </div>
        )
        Profile.propTypes = {
            user: React.PropTypes.object,
        }

    - **Container** and **presentational** pattern: React components typically contain a mix of logic and presentation.
        - By **logic**, we refer to anything that is **unrelated** to the UI, such a API calls, data manipulation, and event handlers.
        - The **presentation** is, instead, **the part inside the render method** where we create the elements to be displayed on the UI.
        - **Container Components**
            - They are more concerned about the behavior 
            - They render their presentational components 
            - They make API calls and manipulate data 
            - They define event handlers
            - They are written as classes
            ```
                your class component goes here..
            ```
        - **Presentational Components**
            -They are more concerned with the visual representation 
            - They render the HTML markup (or other components) 
            - They receive data from the parents in the form of props 
            - They are often written as stateless functional components
            ```
            import React form 'react';
            import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
            const Geolocation = ({ latitude, longitude }) => (
                <div>
                <div>Latitude: {latitude}</div>
                <div>Longitude: {longitude}</div>
                </div>
            );

            Geolocation.propTypes = {
                latitude: PropTypes.number,
                longitude:PropTypes.number,
            }
            ```
        
- **Mixins** Components are great to achieve reusability, but what if different **components in different domains share the same behavior?**
    - **Using mixins is no longer recommended**, but it is worth understanding the problems they tried to solve and see what the possible alternative solutions are.
    - First of all, **mixins work only with the createClass factory**, so if you are using classes, you cannot use mixins. 
        ```
        const WindowResize = React.creatClass({
             getInitialState() {
                return {
                innerWidth: window.innerWidth,
                }
            },
            componentDidMount() {
                window.addEventListener('resize', this.handleResize)
            },
            componentWillUnmount() {
                window.removeEventListener('resize', this.handleResize)
            },
            handleResize() {
                this.setState({
                innerWidth: window.innerWidth,
                })
            }
        });
        ```
        ```
         const MyComponent = React.createClass({
            mixins: [WindowResize, TestMixin],
            render() {
            console.log('window.innerWidth', this.state.innerWidth);
            console.log('test.users', this.state.username);
            <!-- ... your extra code...  -->
        }, });
        ```
        We can using the **[WindowResize, TestMixin]** in one component so it's a kind of getting methods/objects from multiple components and using it in one component.
- **Higher Order Components**
    - Higher order funtions are the functions that are returing new functions.
    - **HOC** HoCs are functions that **take a component as input** and **return an enhanced one** as the output.
        ```
        const HoC = Component => EnhancedComponent      
        ```
        ```
        const withClassName = (Component) => props => (
            <Component {...props} className="my-class" />
        );
        ```
        - We declared a **withClassName** function with **Component** as **parameter** which is a **function** returning **another function**.
    - The **returned** function is a **stateless functional component** that **receives some props and renders the original component**. The collected props are spread and a className property with the "my-class" value is passed to it.
    - **Recompose** It's a popular library which gives you many HOC's
